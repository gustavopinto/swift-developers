    - What motivated you to learn Swift?
    - What made swift easy/difficult to learn?
	- What are the data sources you use to get updated with Swift? (understand/study/learn)
    * If the interviewee knows objective-c *
	- Did objective-c help to ease the learning? How/Why?
 

(3) General Problems
    - What are the most common problems that face when using Swift?

>> So, our last questions are about Error Handling...
	
    - Are you familiar with the concept of Error Handling?

	* if the interviewee used Swift 2.0* 
    - Have you used it in Swift 2.0? How/Why?
    
	* if the interviewee used both*

	- If so, What were the challenges in doing so?

We would like to thank you again. 

We plan to publish this interview as a part of our research and if would like to receive a copy of the paper we would be glad to share with you. 

Do you have any questions or comments?!
